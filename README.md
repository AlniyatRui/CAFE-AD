## Setup Environment & Dataset Preparation

Setup the nuPlan dataset and conda environment following the https://github.com/jchengai/pluto.
All methods are trained on a randomly selected 100k-split dataset, the corresponding scenario tokens are saved in the [token_list.txt file](https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD/blob/master/token_list.txt).

## Training

Our method is implemented based on [PLUTO](https://github.com/jchengai/pluto).

Change the `nuplan` configuration in the [script/run_pluto_planner](https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD/blob/master/train.sh) and then execute the following command:
    
   ```
   sh train.sh
   ```
Our method requires multiple forward passes during processing, which increases the demand for computational resources, so we use a smaller training dataset than PLUTO.

## Inference

1. **Update the Configuration**  
   Change the `nuplan` configuration in the [script/run_pluto_planner](https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD/blob/master/script/run_pluto_planner.sh) file.

2. **Run the Simulation for `test14-hard` Benchmark**  
   Once the configuration is updated, execute the simulation for the `test14-hard` benchmark using the following command:
    
   ```
   sh simulation.sh
   ```
   
3. **Notes**
    This repo also includes simple implenmentation for running log replay and testing the IDM model.
    In the original PLUTO code, the rule-based post-processing would throw an error when no reference line was available. These errors were due to failures in the post-processing in some frames, so we used pure learning results to prevent these errors in those frames.
